             <p class="mp">Michael Phelps, without a dought in my mind the best athlete to ever walk the planet. He holds the world record for most Olympic medals and has an amazing story to tell. Swimming, probably one of the hardest sports ever due to the amount of dedication needed to become great. Michael Phelps, practiced every day for 6 years without missing a single day. That surpasses every athete on my list even if it was the top one hundred. Micheal Phelps for sure deserves this spot and, that concludes my list. </p>
