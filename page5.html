        <p class="pele">Pelé, he was one of the best soccer players in history and arguably the best, he deserves this spot because of his story. Pelé grew p poor, playing on the streets with a coconuts with his naboors in the slums. He then became a world great after a long journey of football/soccer. Unfortunately he passed away December 29th 2022 but, he will never be forgotten and will always have a place in every football/soccer players heart.</p>
