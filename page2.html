            <center><p class="kobewritting">I believe Kobe Bryant for sure deserved a spot on my list for many reasons. First of all, he is a world wide known basketball player with many viral plays. He was 6 foot 6 inches, that is very but, for a NBA legend it is about the average height. This is a huge factor in his greatness because, he was an average sized guy who absolutely crushed his oponents when is comes to the court. 
             He would get up at 4 before scool and go to the gym to practice and practice over and over again. Kobe was so good every hooper across the world started to call out his name while releasing the ball to shoot because Kobe never missed. As we all know him and his daughter died in a helicopter crash on January 26th 2020. This was one of the saddest deaths in basketball history. But with that, Kobe Bryant defenitely deserves this spot.
