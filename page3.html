            <p class="alisa">Heavyweight boxing world champion and Olympic gold medalist, Muhammad Ali makes the 4th place spot on my list. He is universally considered as one of the best athletes to exist. Muhammad Ali won 56 six times in his 21 year career. He was a chaismatic, fearless boxing legend. 
            Ali trained every day to become the worlds best boxer. Even when he didn't want to be training he still did because he was dedicated, that is what seperated him from everyone else. He has many inspiring quotes such as the ones above which define his state of mind, a hard working 
            athlete with nothing in his way. Muhammad Ali, deserves the 4th best athlete in history.
